I'm currently working as a Sr. Front-End Engineer at [Citrix](https://www.citrix.com/), a company that provides server, application, and desktop virtualization, networking, and cloud computing technologies.

I also volunteer as Mentoring Coordinator at [TechLabs Berlin](https://techlabs.org/), a completely free platform for people from all disciplines to learn different programming skills.

Other than this, I'm casually [speaking](/talks), [writing](/posts), traveling & advocating for craft brewing.

Feel free to reach me out on social networks, [Whereby](https://whereby.com/ythecombinator), or schedule something on [my calendar](https://calendly.com/ythecombinator). Last but not least, you can write to me through [land@ythecombinator.space](mailto:land@ythecombinator.space).
