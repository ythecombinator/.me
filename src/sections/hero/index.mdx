I'm currently working as a Front-End Engineer at [STRV](https://www.strv.com/), a Prague-based strategy, design, and engineering company.

Also, I'm casually [speaking](/talks), [writing](/posts), travelling & advocating for craft brewing.

Feel free to reach me out on social networks, [Whereby](https://whereby.com/ythecombinator) or schedule something on [my calendar](https://calendly.com/ythecombinator). Last but not least, you can write to me through [land@ythecombinator.space](mailto:land@ythecombinator.space).
