I am passionate about open-source software and giving back to others.

I admit I am not quite often focusing on OSS, though, but here are some highlighted projects from my Github:

### Other stuff

There also some projects I've worked that are not open-sourced (yet).

One of them I would mention is [Blau](http://blaugame.com/); a challenging physics-based minimalist puzzle game for iOS.

I helped to conceive the whole design approach of the game and to implement its mechanics.

On top of Blau success, my friends and I founded a small digital games atelier & software craftwork house based in our hometown: [Xablauger Studios](https://github.com/xablauger-studios).
