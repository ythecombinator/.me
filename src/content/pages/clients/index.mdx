On my journey as a Front-End Software Engineer focused on new and scalable technologies, I've worked with different software design & engineering companies that helped a wide range of clients on digital transformation, strategy, and more.

I always aim to help them meet their business goals, without leaving quality aside. Here are some of them:

And here are a few more details on our cooperation:

### [Outfront Media](https://www.outfrontmedia.com/)

[Outfront Media](https://www.outfrontmedia.com/) is one of the largest outdoor media companies. It operates in markets including the United States and Canada.

I helped them build their large-scale geographic data visualization platforms and assets curation systems from scratch.

Technologies used:

- React and Next.js
- redux and related tooling (e.g. redux-saga, redux-act, reselect, etc.)
- JavaScript and TypeScript
- Map data plotting and analyzation tools (e.g. Mapbox GL, Turf.js, pbf, etc.)
- Firebase services (Auth, Cloud Functions, Firestore, etc.)
- Authentication, authorization and accounting infrastructure (mostly with Auth0 and node.js)

### [Minted](https://www.minted.com)

[Minted](https://www.minted.com) is an online marketplace of independent artists and designers. The company crowdsources art and graphic design through monthly design challenges.

I helped them redesigning both their Cart and Checkout pages in a short time in advance of their sales peak in November.

Technologies used:

- React
- JavaScript
- Emotion CSS

### [Surge](https://www.surgeapp.co/)

[Surge](https://www.surgeapp.co/) is currently the fastest growing gay dating app on the US market and the most searched gay dating app on the Apple App Store.

I helped them build a CLI tool that provides some App Store connect utilities for doing some experiments with in-app purchases pricing (basically A/B testing with IAP prices).

Technologies used:

- Puppeteer
- JavaScript and TypeScript
- CLI utilities (e.g. meow, chalk, etc.)
- Google APIs (for building spreadsheets with prices for IAPs)

### [Live Penalty](https://www.livepenalty.com/)

The core of the project is a customized football launching machine that can be controlled by multiple players through their phones, letting you score goals against real goalkeepers, with a real ball, in a real stadium. But, from your living room (or wherever you find yourself).

I built from scratch the application that runs in the LED panel behind the goal, which is a crucial part of the experience because it displays dynamic game animations and information.

Also, I helped to build new features for the administration app (a web application that is dedicated to the moderator, allowing him/her to see all information about the game, and another part is for the referee).

Technologies used:

- React
- JavaScript and TypeScript
- styled-components
- CSS animations
- Canvas and WebGL
- Netlify
