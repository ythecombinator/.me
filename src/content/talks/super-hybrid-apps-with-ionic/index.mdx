[Abra√£o](https://github.com/AbraaoAlves) and I will make an overview of the features of [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/): a framework for creating hybrid apps that has been growing more and more. It's free and open source and offers a HTML, CSS and JS library optimized for smartphones - as well as great tools that give us a great alternative for mobile development.
