Writing fluid user interfaces becomes increasingly challenging as the application complexity increases. Thankfully, the React core team has been putting a lot of effort to improve this since the React Fiber rewrite – and, more recently, with features like Time Slicing, Suspense and a few new libraries resulting from Fiber.

Yet, in a world where all we hear are hooks™, the way these different pieces of the Concurrent React umbrella work is not always well detailed.

That's why we’ll explore how properly scheduling UI work improves your app’s user experience by diving into Concurrent React and learning how it improves the responsiveness of web applications.

Last but not least, we'll take a glimpse into the future of the Web platform.
