The core of the project is a customized football launching machine that can be controlled by multiple players through their phones, letting you score goals against real goalkeepers, with a real ball, in a real stadium. But, from your living room (or wherever you find yourself).

Using the newest technology, [Live Penalty](https://www.livepenalty.com/) translates a playerâ€™s mobile command into real-life action within a revolutionary 0.5 seconds. Players play to win and are gradually eliminated based on a point system.

## Cooperation

I built from scratch the application that runs in the LED panel behind the goal, which is a crucial part of the experience because it displays dynamic game animations and information.

Also, I helped to build new features for the administration app (a web application that is dedicated to the moderator, allowing him/her to see all information about the game, and another part is for the referee).

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- JavaScript and TypeScript
- CSS animations
- Canvas and WebGL
