[Surge](https://www.surgeapp.co/) is currently the fastest growing gay dating app on the US market and the most searched gay dating app on the Apple App Store.

## Cooperation

I helped them build a CLI tool that provides some App Store connect utilities for doing some experiments with in-app purchases pricing (basically A/B testing with IAP prices).

## Technologies Used

- Puppeteer
- CLI utilities (e.g. meow, chalk, etc.)
- Google APIs (for building spreadsheets with prices for IAPs)
