[Blau](http://blaugame.com) is a challenging physics-based minimalist puzzle game for iOS.

## Cooperation

I helped to conceive the whole design approach of the game and to implement its mechanics.

On top of Blau success, my friends and I founded a small digital games atelier & software craftwork house based in our hometown: [Xablauger Studios](https://github.com/xablauger-studios).

## Technologies Used

- Swift
- SpriteKit
- GameCenter
