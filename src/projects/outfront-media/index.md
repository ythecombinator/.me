[Outfront Media](https://www.outfrontmedia.com/) is one of the largest outdoor media companies. It operates in markets including the United States and Canada.

## Cooperation

I helped them build their large-scale geographic data visualization platforms and assets curation systems from scratch.

## Technologies Used

- React and Next.js
- redux and related tooling (e.g. redux-saga, redux-act, reselect, etc.)
- JavaScript and TypeScript
- Webpack and bundle optimization techniques (prefetching, code splitting, common chunks, dynamic imports, service workers, web workers, compile-time optimization, etc.)
- Map data plotting and analyzation tools (e.g. Mapbox GL, Turf.js, pbf, etc.)
- Firebase services (Auth, Cloud Functions, Firestore, etc.)
- Authentication, authorization and accounting infrastructure (mostly with Auth0 and node.js)
