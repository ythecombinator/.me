## Intro

✋ Hi folks! I'm just another constantly evolving full-stack developer draft who
inhabits this world.

💜 My areas of interest/passions include: JavaScript, Swift, architecture 
patterns, User Interfaces libraries and frameworks developer tooling, 
functional and reactive programming, unix philosophy, and User Interaction 
design.

👥 I also try to help as much as I can Brazilian local communities like Dev I/O 
Foundation, Ionic Brazil, CocoaHeads Fortaleza, Lambda I/O Foundation, and many
others!

📢 In addition to attending and organizing meetups and conferences, I really like
to bring cool things to where I'm invited to speak; if you want to see some of 
my lectures, [here](/talks) they are.

💻 As I mentioned, I also love open source, if you'd like to stalk me on GitHub, 
[don't ever hesitate](https://github.com/ythecombinator).
