geodata company.

how addicted I am to emojis.

## Intro

✋ Hi folks! I'm just another constantly evolving full-stack developer draft who
inhabits this world.

💜 My areas of interest/passions include: JavaScript, Swift, architecture 
patterns, User Interfaces libraries and frameworks developer tooling, 
functional and reactive programming, unix philosophy, and User Interaction 
design.

👥 I also try to help as much as I can Brazilian local communities like Dev I/O 
Foundation, Ionic Brazil, CocoaHeads Fortaleza, Lambda I/O Foundation, and many
others!

📢 In addition to attending and organizing meetups and conferences, I really like
to bring cool things to where I'm invited to speak; if you want to see some of 
my lectures, [here](/talks) they are.

💻 As I mentioned, I also love open source, if you'd like to stalk me on GitHub, 
[don't ever hesitate](https://github.com/ythecombinator).

## Travelling

As I started working as a remote developer (~ early 2018) besides travelling a lot
more through my homeland, I decided to travel and live a little around the world for a 
while – not staying for too long on any city. 

These are the countries where I've been to in this journey:

## Working

### Engineering Leader, Front-End

🏢 Beakyn Company

🌎 New York City, USA (Remote)

📅 Feb 2018 – Present

📃 As an engineering leader on a few of the company's most recent projects, I’ve 
been responsible for ensuring the team balances all of the following: working at 
a speed guided by direction, not pace; delivering on its promises to potential
customers, and applying my expertise as a guiding force growing and developing
the team. 

It's been an exciting role that does not have strict boundaries, giving me the
opportunity to expand my impact where I see value to the engineering team and 
our business and where I have the freedom to identify opportunities and create s
olutions that enable fast UI innovation.

At the same time, it demands a considerable background in software engineering, 
front-end and back-end architecture, continuous integration and collaboration. 
It challenges me to operate at a tactical and strategic level, while ensuring 
the team manages high availability and stable infrastructure to maximize 
performance. It requires a good insight into the software development lifecycle 
for production services and experience as a leader of a talented and capable 
engineering team as well.
