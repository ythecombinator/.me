### Description

We will see how old concepts of functional programming can make a huge difference nowadays for JS developers through [LiveScript](http://livescript.net/): a preprocessor which brings many syntax enhancements and other features and became a great alternative to start in the functional world. After this *NUG-CE* - equipped with *first-class functions*, *high-order functions*, *currying*, *composition*, *pipes* and other things - you'll probably never write the same code again.
